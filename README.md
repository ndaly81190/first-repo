# My First Repo
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the National Gallery, working in collaboration with the research groups of Profs. Miguel Rodrigues and Pier Luigi Dragotti, in the EEE departments at UCL and Imperial College, respectively.

Our project, Art through the ICT lens (ARTICT) aims to develop new algorithms to better process, fuse, and interpret Macro X-ray Fluorescence (MA-XRF) scanning and Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) datasets collected on cultural heritage objects.
